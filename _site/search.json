She is a strong proponent of mixed-methods research and designs that leverage passive and routine programme data and vetted secondary information sources. She is especially proficient in qualitative data collection and analysis (individual semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and ethnographic observations), as well as in survey design and quantitative analysis (using descriptive, inferential, multivariate statistics). One of her strengths is the ability to combine data science techniques (e.g., text analysis, automating data cleaning and wrangling and social media analytics) with information visualisation, informed by social science and MEL and guided by design thinking and a deep understanding of work requirements and of aid professionals."
