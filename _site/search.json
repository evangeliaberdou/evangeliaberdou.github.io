    "text": "Methodologies\nExperienced in the design and application of a range of M&E approaches including theory-based methods, results frameworks (inc. logframes), outcome harvesting and mapping, portfolio syntheses, and most significant change. Evangelia has applied these approaches in the context of realist, developmental, utilisation-focused, process and impact evaluations. She is a strong proponent of mixed-methods research and designs that leverage passive and routine programme data and vetted secondary information sources. She is especially proficient in qualitative data collection and analysis (individual semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and ethnographic observations), as well as in survey design and quantitative analysis (using descriptive, inferential, multivariate statistics). One of her strengths is the ability to combine data science techniques (e.g., text analysis, automating data cleaning and wrangling and social media analytics) with information visualisation, informed by social science and MEL and guided by design thinking and a deep understanding of work requirements and of aid professionals."

    "section": "",
    "text": "There are good reasons to expect that AI will transform MEL practice - and work in general). Whilst waiting for the hype to settle, it’s worth paying attention to the small but meaningful improvements AI can bring about in our everyday work.\nTake, for example, the task of compiling a list of acronyms for a lengthy proposal or report. It’s a tedious job, often left to the last minute, and rarely appreciated.\nWith ChatGPT’s help I created a VBA Macro for Microsoft Word, which:\na) Generates a list of acronyms with page numbers for where each acronym first appears;\nb) Notes the number of times the acronym is mentioned.\nThe resulting acronym list is copied in a separate Word doc for further processing.\n\nInstructions\n\nCopy the VBA macro.\nMake sure that your Word document is open and editable.\nOpen the Visual Basic Editor (tip: type in ‘vba’ in the search bar). With the VBA editor open\n\nGo to Insert &gt; Module.\nOnce the new module window has appeared copy the VBA code included in the next section (everything under Details).\nClick outside the module editing window and go to Run &gt; Run Macro\nThis will open another window with the macro ExtractAcronymsWithPages. Click Run.\nIf all goes to plan, Word will create a new doc with the acronym list.\nNote that there is an option in the VBA that allows you to exclude certain words from the acronym search (`ignoreList = Array(” “). The word you wish to exclude should be placed in between the double quotes.\n\n\nI have used the Macro successfully in Word on Windows and on the Mac."
