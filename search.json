Evangelia has applied these approaches in the context of realist, developmental, utilisation-focused, process and impact evaluations. She is a strong proponent of mixed-methods research and designs that leverage passive and routine programme data and vetted secondary information sources. She is especially proficient in qualitative data collection and analysis (individual semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and ethnographic observations), as well as in survey design and quantitative analysis (using descriptive, inferential, multivariate statistics). One of her strengths is the ability to combine data science techniques (e.g., text analysis, automating data cleaning and wrangling and social media analytics) with information visualisation, informed by social science and MEL and guided by design thinking and a deep understanding of work requirements and of aid professionals."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Vibe coding  is an emerging trend in AI-supported software development, which has received little attention from Monitoring Evaluation Research and Learning (MERL) professionals, compared to other AI applications. It’s a simple but powerful idea: you describe what you want to solve in plain language, and the AI writes the code to make it happen. I have been experimenting with vibe coding for data analytics and interactive reporting, and for making evercyday tasks easier.\nOne example? Creating acronym lists for long proposals or reports. It’s one of those thankless, time-consuming tasks that usually gets pushed to the very end of the process.\nWith ChatGPT’s help I created a VBA Macro for Microsoft Word, which:\na) Scans the document and generates a list of acronyms, including the page number where each first appears;\nb) Tracks how many times each acronym is used.\nThe final list gets exported to a new Word document, ready for formatting or whatever comes next.\n\nInstructions:\n\nCopy the  VBA macro \nMake sure your document is open and editable.\nOpen the Visual Basic Editor (tip: type in ‘vba’ in the search bar in Word).\nIn the editor go to Insert &gt; Module.\n\nPaste the VBA code into the new module window.\nClick outside the module and go to Run &gt; Run Macro.\n\nIn the pop-up, select ExtractAcronymsWithPages and hit Run.\n\nIf everything runs smoothly, Word will generate a new document with the compiled acronym list.\nNote that there is a setting in the code that allows you to exclude certain words: just add them inside the double quotes in ignoreList = Array(\" \").\nI’ve tested the macro on both Windows and Mac versions of Word—it works great on both. I hope you find it useful."
