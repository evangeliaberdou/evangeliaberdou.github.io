  abstract = {Background: Data analysis approaches such as qualitative content analysis are notoriously time and labor intensive because of the time to detect, assess, and code a large amount of data. Tools such as ChatGPT may have tremendous potential in automating at least some of the analysis. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the utility of ChatGPT in conducting qualitative content analysis through the analysis of forum posts from people sharing their experiences on reducing their sugar consumption. Methods: Inductive and deductive content analysis were performed on 537 forum posts to detect mechanisms of behavior change. Thorough prompt engineering provided appropriate instructions for ChatGPT to execute data analysis tasks. Data identification involved extracting change mechanisms from a subset of forum posts. The precision of the extracted data was assessed through comparison with human coding. On the basis of the identified change mechanisms, coding schemes were developed with ChatGPT using data-driven (inductive) and theory-driven (deductive) content analysis approaches. The deductive approach was informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework using both an unconstrained coding scheme and a structured coding matrix. In total, 10 coding schemes were created from a subset of data and then applied to the full data set in 10 new conversations, resulting in 100 conversations each for inductive and unconstrained deductive analysis. A total of 10 further conversations coded the full data set into the structured coding matrix. Intercoder agreement was evaluated across and within coding schemes. ChatGPT output was also evaluated by the researchers to assess whether it reflected prompt instructions. Results: The precision of detecting change mechanisms in the data subset ranged from 66\% to 88\%. Overall {$\kappa$} scores for intercoder agreement ranged from 0.72 to 0.82 across inductive coding schemes and from 0.58 to 0.73 across unconstrained coding schemes and structured coding matrix. Coding into the best-performing coding scheme resulted in category-specific {$\kappa$} scores ranging from 0.67 to 0.95 for the inductive approach and from 0.13 to 0.87 for the deductive approaches. ChatGPT largely followed prompt instructions in producing a description of each coding scheme, although the wording for the inductively developed coding schemes was lengthier than specified. Conclusions: ChatGPT appears fairly reliable in assisting with qualitative analysis. ChatGPT performed better in developing an inductive coding scheme that emerged from the data than adapting an existing framework into an unconstrained coding scheme or coding directly into a structured matrix. The potential for ChatGPT to act as a second coder also appears promising, with almost perfect agreement in at least 1 coding scheme. The findings suggest that ChatGPT could prove useful as a tool to assist in each phase of qualitative content analysis, but multiple iterations are required to determine the reliability of each stage of analysis.},

NLP technology uses statistical analysis of language structures to analyse and generate human language, using text or speech as its source material. It can also be applied to visual mediums like images and videos. A few qualitative research early adopters are beginning to adopt this technology into their work, but our understanding of its potential remains in its infancy. This article will define and describe NLPbased AI and discuss its benefits and limitations for reflexive thematic analysis in health research. While there are many platforms available, ChatGPT is the most well-known and accessible. A worked example using ChatGPT to augment reflexive thematic analysis is provided to illustrate potential application in practice. This article is intended to inspire further conversation around the role of AI in qualitative research and offer practical guidance for researchers seeking to adopt this technology.},

  abstract = {Qualitative research, used to analyse non-numerical data including interview texts, is crucial in understanding medical education processes. However, it is often complex and time-consuming, leading to an interest in technology for streamlining the analysis. This study investigated the applicability of ChatGPT, a large language model, in thematic analysis for medical qualitative research. Previous research has used ChatGPT to explore the deductive process as a qualitative study. This study evaluated thematic analysis including the inductive process by ChatGPT with reference to human qualitative analysis. A convergent design mixed-methods study was used. Using a thematic analysis approach, ChatGPT (model: GPT-4) analysed some interview data from a previously published medical research article. The assessors evaluated the qualitative analysis of ChatGPT using human qualitative analysis as a benchmark. Three assessors compared the human-conducted and ChatGPT-driven qualitative analyses. ChatGPT scored higher in most aspects but showed variable transferability and mixed depth scores. In the integrated analysis including qualitative data, six themes were identified: superficial similarity of results with human analysis, good first impression, explicit association with data and process, contamination by directions in prompts, deficiency of thick descriptions based on context and research questions, and lack of theoretical derivation. ChatGPT excels at extracting key data points and summarising information; however, it is prone to prompt contamination, which necessitates careful scrutiny. To achieve deeper analysis, it is essential to supplement the research context with human input and explore the theoretical framework.},

Rough inputs for a rather naive use ("Conduct a qualitative content analysis!") as well as differentiated specifications with questions and more precise coding instructions (prompts) led in both versions at most to rough approximations of the sample solution with a large number of gross errors. The program did not react or reacted incorrectly to different content analysis concepts (BRAUN \& CLARKE, 2006; KUCKARTZ, 2014; MAYRING, 2022a; SCHREIER, 2012), did not recognize hidden text content, and failed to check for coding agreement. The results of the software, no matter what specifications were made, mostly pointed in the direction of a rough, superficial summary in the sense of a list of topics and thus appear to be less suitable for the qualitative content analysis methods I developed (MAYRING, 2022a, 2022b).},

  abstract = {Background: Qualitative research is crucial for understanding the values and beliefs underlying individual experiences, emotions, and behaviors, particularly in social sciences and health care. Traditionally reliant on manual analysis by experienced researchers, this methodology requires significant time and effort. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, especially large language models such as ChatGPT (OpenAI), holds promise for enhancing qualitative data analysis. However, existing studies have predominantly focused on AI's application to English-language datasets, leaving its applicability to non-English languages, particularly structurally and contextually complex languages such as Japanese, insufficiently explored. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, strengths, and limitations of ChatGPT-4 in analyzing qualitative Japanese interview data by directly comparing its performance with that of experienced human researchers. Methods: A comparative qualitative study was conducted to assess the performance of ChatGPT-4 and human researchers in analyzing transcribed Japanese semistructured interviews. The analysis focused on thematic agreement rates, interpretative depth, and ChatGPT's ability to process culturally nuanced concepts, particularly for descriptive and socio-culturally embedded themes. This study analyzed transcripts from 30 semistructured interviews conducted between February and March 2024 in an urban community hospital (Hospital A) and a rural university hospital (Hospital B) in Japan. Interviews centered on the theme of ``sacred moments'' and involved health care providers and patients. Transcripts were digitized using NVivo (version 14; Lumivero) and analyzed using ChatGPT-4 with iterative prompts for thematic analysis. The results were compared with a reflexive thematic analysis performed by human researchers. Furthermore, to assess the adaptability and consistency of ChatGPT in qualitative analysis, Charmaz's grounded theory and Pope's five-step framework approach were applied. Results: ChatGPT-4 demonstrated high thematic agreement rates ({$>$}80\%) with human researchers for descriptive themes such as ``personal experience of a sacred moment'' and ``building relationships.'' However, its performance declined for themes requiring deeper cultural and emotional interpretation, such as ``difficult to answer, no experience of sacred moments'' and ``fate.'' For these themes, agreement rates were approximately 30\%, revealing significant limitations in ChatGPT's ability to process context-dependent linguistic structures and implicit emotional expressions in Japanese. Conclusions: ChatGPT-4 demonstrates potential as an auxiliary tool in qualitative research, particularly for efficiently identifying descriptive themes within Japanese-language datasets. However, its limited capacity to interpret cultural and emotional nuances highlights the continued necessity of human expertise in qualitative analysis. These findings emphasize the complementary role of AI-assisted qualitative research and underscore the importance of further advancements in AI models tailored to non-English linguistic and cultural contexts. Future research should explore strategies to enhance AI's interpretability, expand multilingual},

In this research, the case study of the qualitative research method was preferred. The data of the research consists of interview texts of two participants from an unpublished study. The texts were subjected to qualitative research analysis process through ChatGPT-4. Data analysis was done in two separate ways, specifying code, category and theme and not specifying. In conclusion, it has been found that ChatGPT can create code, category and theme, cite directly from within the text, interpret data sets, and analyze the meaning at the core of the data sets.
