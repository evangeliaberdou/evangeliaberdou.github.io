We've all been there.
You assign task to an AI, only to receive response that's either too generic, lacking empirical backing, or in a format that's hard to reuse and edit for further work.

The good news?
**You don’t need to be a programmer to get better results from AI**.

By customising the settings in your chosen AI platform, you can save time, minimise frustration, and obtain better results.

It just takes a moment to think through your needs, phrase them in a way the AI understands, and plug them into your AI's settings.

This example focuses on **ChatGPT** and requires a **ChatGPT Plus subscription**, though the general approach applies to other mainstream AI platforms like Gemini and Claude (though I haven’t confirmed if these options are available in their free versions).

# Customising your AI

You can tailor your AI’s responses in individual chats—but there’s also a way to convey your broader preferences so that they apply across all your chats.

Think of it as onboarding a new assistant which consistently remembers and applies every instruction.

Here is a summary of the [:parameters](#x-instructions) that I use to customise ChatGPT, organised by theme.
For guidance on where the appropriate settings are located click [:here](#x-settings).

### Where to input your preferences in ChatGPT

-   Assuming you have a **ChatGPT Plus subscription**, click your account icon (top-right corner) and select *Customize ChatGPT* as shown by the blue arrow in the screenshot below.

-   Paste your preferences into'What traits should ChatGPT have' field.

-   If you run into the character limit under, move some of the text to another field **within** the *Customised ChatGPT* window, like *Other things that ChatGPT should know about you.*

-   While you are at it, consider reviewing your **privacy settings** (if you have not done so already).
    Most AI tools allow you to control whether your interactions are used to train the model.
    If you're dealing with sensitive or proprietary data, it's best to disable data sharing

-   In ChatGPT go to Settings \> Data Controls and ensure that the option **Improve the Model for everyone** is **OFF**.

-   If you are using a different platform (e.g. Claude, Gemini) and you cannot locate these settings, ask your AI.
    As far as I know, Microsoft CoPilot doesn’t offer similar user-facing options.

# My customisation parameters

#### **Communication Style:**

-   Casual and friendly tone, using my name

-   British English

-   Clear and concise

-   Prioritise honesty over politeness

#### **Output Structure:**

-   Main output distinct from commentary (to facilitate copying)

-   Ready for Notion (markdown tables, proper code blocks)

-   Tables with defined columns for recommendations and search results

-   Context and explanations included below the main output

#### **Search and Research Guidelines**

-   Web search real-time or changing information

-   Cross-check multiple sources for complex queries

-   Include confidence levels for factual assertions

#### **Operations Management:**

-   Wait for complete instructions before acting 

-   Stick to the task given—no premature suggestions

# The Bigger Picture

As with human communication, **the more clearly you state your expectations, the better your AI will perform.**

This approach can be adapted for different groups. For example:

-   **Academics** can specify citation formats and evidence levels
-   **Analysts** can standardise reporting and data styles
-   **Creators** can reinforce voice, tone, and brand consistency

**Customisation doesn’t make your AI foolproof.** It can still hallucinate, so you'll need to fact-check and adjust outputs.
But it does help produce results that are more aligned with your expectations and workflow—making the AI a bit more reliable, overall.

# The Next Step: Organising your AI Interactions with Projects

These adjustments establish a solid foundation for enhancing AI output quality and better integrating it into your workflow. That said, there are additional improvements you can explore.

In a next post, I’ll explore how to use **Projects**, a feature now found in several AI platforms, to give your AI greater context—such as reference documents, quality benchmarks, and ongoing objectives—to further enhance its performance.
