There are good reasons to expect that AI will transform MEL practice - and work in general).
Whilst waiting for the hype to settle, it's worth paying attention to the small but meaningful improvements AI can bring about in our everyday work.

Take, for example, the task of compiling a list of acronyms for a lengthy proposal or report.
It’s a tedious job, often left to the last minute, and rarely appreciated.

With ChatGPT’s help I created a VBA Macro for Microsoft Word, which:

a\) Generates a list of acronyms with page numbers for where each acronym first appears;

b\) Notes the number of times the acronym is mentioned.

The resulting acronym list is copied in a separate Word doc for further processing.

### Instructions

-   Copy the VBA [macro](../assets/Code-VBA-Acronyms.txt).
-   Make sure that your Word document is open and editable.
-   Open the Visual Basic Editor (tip: type in ‘vba’ in the search bar). With the VBA editor open
    -   Go to Insert \> Module.
    -   Once the new module window has appeared copy the VBA code included in the next section (everything under Details).
    -   Click outside the module editing window and go to Run \> Run Macro
    -   This will open another window with the macro ExtractAcronymsWithPages. Click Run.
    -   If all goes to plan, Word will create a new doc with the acronym list.
    -   Note that there is an option in the VBA that allows you to exclude certain words from the acronym search (\`ignoreList = Array(" "). The word you wish to exclude should be placed in between the double quotes.

I have used the Macro successfully in Word on Windows and on the Mac.
