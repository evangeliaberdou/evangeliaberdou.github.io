Welcome!
I'm a senior consultant with over 15 years of experience in Monitoring, Evaluation Research and Learning (MERL) in international development.

I'm an advocate of mixed methods research and enjoy weaving together ethnographic insights with passive and secondary quantitative data to improve understanding of behaviours, outcomes and impact.
I believe in using routine program data to its fullest and turning to primary research strategically to fill key knowledge gaps.

I use cutting edge analytical tools such as PowerBI and leverage design thinking to create products and services that are engaging, reusable and of value to multiple stakeholders throughout and beyond the duration of a project.

For more details you can download my [CV](Berdou_CV.pdf).

I use this site to share lessons and insights from past and present work.

You can reach me at: evangeliaberdou\[at\]gmail.com.
