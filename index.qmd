Welcome!
I'm a senior consultant with over 15 years of experience in monitoring, evaluation research and learning (MERL) in international development.

I am an expert on how digital tools and, more recently, AI can enhance MEL practice, collaboration, productivity and service delivery.
I have advised on, designed and delivered MEL systems that can genuinely support decision-making and adaptation.
I believe MEL should provide lasting value to different stakeholders and have found that it works best when it leverages existing data flows, automates routine tasks, and creates space for analysis, reflection and discussion both for short-term adjustments and more strategic changes.\


My experience spans health, environment, livelihoods, inclusive governance, gender and capacity building.
I'm drawn to methodological innovationâ€”adapting approaches from fields like UX design or data science when they can genuinely improve understanding and communication.
I'm committed to helping teams build their own digital and analytical competencies while fostering a culture of continuous learning.

You can download my [CV](Berdou_CV.pdf) for more details on all these aspects of my work.

I use this site to share lessons and insights from past and present projects.
